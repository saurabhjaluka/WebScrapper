Design and build a robust text scraper that will connect to a page on www.shopping.com and return results about a given keyword. There are two queries that will be performed:
	•	Query 1: Total number of results
		given a keyword, such as "digital camera", return the total number of results found.
	•	Query 2: Result Object
		given a keyword (e.g. "digital cameras") and page number (e.g. "1"), return the results in a result object and then print results on screen. For each result, return the following information:
	o	Title/Product Name (e.g. "Samsung TL100 Digital Camera")
	o	Price of the product
	o	Shipping Price (e.g. "Free Shipping", "$3.50")
	o	Vendor (e.g. "Amazon", "5 stores")

For "digital cameras", there should be either 40 or 80 results that return for page 1.
